## Lab Introduction

With the introduction of Grail, Dynatrace has fundamentally changed how observability data is stored and opened the door to a wide variety of new reporting and analysis use cases.  To fully take advantage of the possibilities of Grail, it's essential to be familiar with the new **Dynatrace Query Language**.

<br>

This lab will introduce you to the fundamentals of DQL, including:
- The essential commands of DQL
- Constructing a basic DQL query
- Using DQL in Notebooks to explore data
- Querying monitored entities and their relationships in DQL
- Creating charts using the DQL Timeseries command.

<br>

Upon completing this lab, you will be able to use DQL to query basic information on logs, entities, and metrics.

Advanced DQL use cases will be covered in the next HOT session: **DQL in Practice**
